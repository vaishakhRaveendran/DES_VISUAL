Supremica is a tool for the modelling and analysis of discrete-event control functions
based on state machine models of the uncontrolled plant and specication of the desired
closed-loop behaviour. The modelling framework in Supremica is based on nite-state machines
extended with variables, guard conditions, and action functions. In order to handle large-scale
problems of industrially interesting size, Supremica uses advanced model checking techniques
such as symbolic representations and compositional abstraction. Supremica has been used in
several industrial research projects to verify and synthesise control functions for embedded
controllers, industrial robots, and exible manufacturing systems, and to verify program code
for autonomous vehicles.

TCT is intended for supervisor synthesis of systems modeled by finite state automata. The major feature is the computation of the supremal controllable sublanguage for a given plant and specification; thus a designer can achieve maximally permissive nonblocking control.The TCT software is a free and easy-to-use computation tool for the synthesis of supervisors of discrete-event systems.It has implemented many of the basic concepts in supervisory control theory and has been found helpful in both
teaching and research.
